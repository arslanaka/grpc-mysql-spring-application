# Spring Boot gRPC MySQL Integration

This is a sample Spring Boot project that demonstrates the integration of gRPC with MySQL for efficient communication and data storage. It provides a basic setup for building gRPC-based microservices that interact with a MySQL database.

## Features

- Integration of gRPC for efficient communication between microservices.
- MySQL database setup and integration for data storage.
- Sample gRPC service and client for demonstration purposes.
- A minimal Spring Boot application structure for easy customization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Apache Maven for building and managing dependencies.
- MySQL database server running locally or on a remote host.
- Basic knowledge of Spring Boot, gRPC, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your MySQL database connection in `application.properties`.
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`.
4. Run the Spring Boot application: `mvn spring-boot:run`.

## Usage

- The sample gRPC service is available at `localhost:8080`. You can use tools like [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc) to send gRPC requests.
- The MySQL database can be accessed using your preferred MySQL client.
